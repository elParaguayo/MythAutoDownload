MythDownload

Installation instructions:

1) Pick a folder where converted files will be saved
  - Create a subfolder called "downloads"
  - Folder must be writable by MythTV
  
2) Web
  - create a new folder in your web root (usually /var/www)
  - web-user needs write access to the folder
  - Copy web/file.php to that folder
  - Create a symlink to the "downloads" folder created above
  - In a browser, browse to the symlink e.g. "http://localhost/mythdownload/downloads" to check permissions 
  
3) mythdownload
  - Copy bin/mythdownload to /usr/local/bin
  - give execute permissions "sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mythdownload"
  - open file in your favourite editor and edit config section 
  
4) MythTV
  - Create a new user job:
    - mythdownload "%DIR%/%FILE%" "%TITLE%" "%STARTTIME%"
    
5) Phone
  - (I assume Tasker and AutoRemote are already installed)
  - Copy Tasker/MythDownload.prf.xml to your phone
  - Import xml into Tasker
  
That should be it!
